Implement a Hashtable Class with the following methods:

`set`

- Arguments: key, value
- Returns: nothing
- This method should hash the key, and set the key and value pair in the table, handling collisions as needed.
- Should a given key already exist, replace its value from the `value` argument given to this method.


`get`

- Arguments: key
- Returns: Value associated with that key in the table

`has`

- Arguments: key
- Returns: Boolean, indicating if the key exists in the table already.

`keys`

- Returns: Collection of keys

`hash`

- Arguments: key
- Returns: Index in the collection for that key
