# Collection: Linked List

[Assignment instructions](https://codefellows.github.io/common_curriculum/data_structures_and_algorithms/Code_401/class-05/LAB)

## TypeScript Instructions

- Verify your types are correct with `npm run check`
- Verify your implementation is correct with `npm run test`
  - When converting the value in a node to a string, use the `display` function in [`Collection.ts`](./src/Collection.ts).
- DO NOT edit [assignment.test.ts](./src/).
- Add your own tests to [LinkedList.test.ts](./src/LinkedList.test.ts).
- Tests must pass the github workflow for full credit.

- [Typescript Handbook](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/intro.html)

### Common Types

- `boolean` is `true` or `false`.
- `number` is any JavaScript number - `5`, `-17`, `22.356`, `3/10`, `Number.MAX_VALUE`, etc.
- `string` is any JavaScript string - `'hello'`, `'goodbye'`, `\`I am ${age}\``
- `interface Person { name: string; age: number; }` is a JavaScript object with two properties, `name` and `age`. `name` must be a string, and `age` must be a number.
- `(name: string, age: number) => Person` is a function with two parameters, `name` (a string) and `age` (a number), which will return an object of type `Person`.
- `() => void` is a function with no arguments, and returns nothing.
  <!-- - `'hello'`' is the JavaScript string `'hello'` and no other string. -->
  <!-- - `'hello'|'goodbye'` is either the JavaScript string `'hello'` or the string `'goodbye'`, and no other strings. -->

# Singly Linked List
<!-- Short summary or background information -->

## Challenge
### Node

- Create a Node class that has properties for the value stored in the Node, and a pointer to the next Node.

### Linked List

- Create a Linked List class
- Within your Linked List class, include a head property.
  - Upon instantiation, an empty Linked List should be created.
- The class should contain the following methods
  - insert
    - Arguments: value
    - Returns: nothing
    - Adds a new node with that value to the `head` of the list with an O(1) Time performance.
  - includes
    - Arguments: value
    - Returns: Boolean
      - Indicates whether that value exists as a Nodeâ€™s value somewhere within the list.
  - to string
    - Arguments: none
    - Returns: a string representing all the values in the Linked List, formatted as:
    - `"{ a } -> { b } -> { c } -> NULL"`

## Challenge Summary
### Feature Tasks
Write the following methods for the Linked List class:

- append
  - arguments: new value
  - adds a new node with the given value to the end of the list
- insert before
  - arguments: value, new value
  - adds a new node with the given new value immediately before the first node that has the value specified
- insert after
  - arguments: value, new value
  - adds a new node with the given new value immediately after the first node that has the value specified
