# Code challenge 38

You work for a video game company, and they have an algorithm that generates mazes for players to solve. The mazes are rooms connected by doors. Some of the doors might be locked with a key of some color, and some rooms have a key in them. But it doesnâ€™t always generate a maze that can be solved! So here are two examples - can you solve the one on the left? (Yes) And the one on the right? (No). So your assignment is to write a function, `can_solve`, which takes a maze as its input and returns boolean `true` if a player could get from the start of the maze to the pot of gold, or false if there is a locked door without an available key between the start and the gold.

Defining the input type of the can_solve function is part of this challenge.

(For Jr Candidates) I want to hear your ideas on how to design the data structure and the algorithm you might use, but also treat this as a collaborative environment and treat me as your tech lead!

function can_solve(???) {
  return ???;
}
